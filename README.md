# Client-subscribed-to-a-term-deposit
This project analyzes a marketing dataset from a bank to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and performance evaluation using various classification techniques.

🧠 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can predict customer responses (yes or no) to a marketing campaign based on historical data.

📁 Dataset
File name: bankmarketing.csv
The dataset contains information about clients contacted during a direct marketing campaign.
Target variable: y (indicates if the client subscribed to a term deposit)

✅ What We Did
Loaded and inspected the bankmarketing.csv dataset.
Handled missing values and performed necessary data cleaning.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and relationships.
Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained and evaluated multiple classification models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest

Measured model performance using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score

📊 Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – for visualization
Scikit-learn – for model building and evaluation

🚀 How to Run
Upload bankmarketing.csv to your project directory.
Install required libraries (if not already installed):(pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn)
Run the Python notebook or script provided.

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing and visualization to model training and performance evaluation. It shows how supervised classification techniques can be used effectively for predictive analytics in marketing.
